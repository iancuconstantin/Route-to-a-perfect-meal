# Route to a perfect meal


## What I`ve learned:

- JSX
- Undestanding the structure of the script `create-react-app`
- adding css file to react project
- adding css style to react project
- displaying lists of objects in react

## Tasks

1. Create a navbar with 4 links: `Recipes`, `Perfection Salad`, `Hamburger Pie`, `Cherry Pineapple Bologna`
    - When the user clicks on the `Recipes` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/`
    - When the user clicks on the `Perfection Salad` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/recipe/1`
    - When the user clicks on the `Hamburger Pie` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/recipe/2`
    - When the user clicks on the `Cherry Pineapple Bologna` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/recipe/3`

2. When the user navigates to `recipe/1` or `recipe/2` or `recipe/3` the same component is used to display the desired recipe
    - When the url in the browser is `recipe/1` the `Perfection Salad` is displayed
    - When the url in the browser is `recipe/2` the `Hamburger Pie` is displayed
    - When the url in the browser is `recipe/3` the `Cherry Pineapple Bologna` is displayed

3. The home page has a carousel (React Responsive Carousel from https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel)
    - The `Home` page has a carousel which displays the image of the 3 recipes
